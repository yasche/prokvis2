The goal of prokvis2 is to provide an easy-to-use Shiny application to create intuitive visualizations of kinome data similar to KinMap [@eid2017] and CORAL [@metz2018]. What is unique about prokvis2 is its ability to visualize the kinomes of several model organisms, including mouse, fruit fly and baker's yeast, besides that of humans.

## Installation

You can install the development version of prokvis2 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("yasche/prokvis2")
```

## Example

prokvis2 has one central user-facing function, `run_app()`, that launches the Shiny application:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(prokvis2)

# Start the app with the internal `kinome_data` object:
run_app()

# Start the app with a user-supplied `kinome_data` file:
run_app(custom_kinome_data = "path/to/kinome_data.rds")
```
