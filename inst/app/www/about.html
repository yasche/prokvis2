<h1>About</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  prokvis2 is an abbreviation and stands for Protein Kinases Visualization.
  It is a small tool to create intuitive visualizations of kinome data and was developed as an alternative to other popular visualization tools like KinMap (Eid et al. 2017) and CORAL (Metz et al. 2018).
  What makes prokvis2 unique is that it can create visualizations of the kinome of species other than human, for example mouse, yeast and fruit fly.
</p>
<p>
  Using prokvis2 does not require any coding skills. The data to visualize can simply be pasted into an Excel-like table.
  prokvis2 provides extensive styling options to fit the need of different publications and use-cases.
</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>
  The plots and kinase tables are created using data from KinBase with kind permission from Gerard Manning (<a href="https://manninglab.org/">https://manninglab.org/</a>).
</p>

<p>
  Accessions and other data from Uniprot was added by running a BLAST search against a recently downloaded (2024) reference proteome of the corresponding species from Uniprot.
  Best hits in terms of bitscore were used for each protein.
